    // it works in a team way. It all begins forking, where you make the project practically yours and you're able to control it freely. There is a buttom that says fork, that's what you're looking for.
    then you should add your TL as your collaborator in git hub. that is on settings, then collaborations. Then you clone the repo, it is a huge green buttom saying clone or download. it is going to give
    you a link.After that you want to open github bash and then you type git clone and the link it shows you. Then you create your own branch by typing git checkout -b"first and last name" and your name. 
    then you type git add . and it will add the changes and make em ready for committing. after that, you type git commit -m"message here", but instead of literally putting message here you should put the
    changes that you've add it to the repo that you're commiting. after that, you type git push -u origin branch-name to push your stuff onto github. (branch name is the name that you gave it before which should
    be your first and last name). after that, you submit a pull request in github. you click the brand master buttom and it will show you your name, select it and then you select new pull request and it will
    redirect you to a page where you instead of clicking "create pull request", you go to the base repository and you select to your forked repo instead of the one that says lambda. then you add your tl to the reviewers
    and then submit the pull request. It is very important that you don't merge pull request as it will be merge after the review is done.
